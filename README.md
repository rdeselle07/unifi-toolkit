## Quick Start

### Requirements
- **Docker** (recommended) or Python 3.9+
- **Ubuntu 22.04/24.04** (or other Linux)

### Local Deployment (LAN Only)

No authentication, access via `http://localhost:8000`

**Prerequisites:** Install Docker first - see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md#option-a-docker-installation-recommended)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/unifi-toolkit.git
cd unifi-toolkit
./setup.sh  # Select 1 for Local

# Start
docker compose up -d
```

Access at **http://localhost:8000**

### Production Deployment (Internet-Facing)

Authentication enabled, HTTPS with Let's Encrypt via Caddy

**Prerequisites:** Install Docker first - see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md#option-a-docker-installation-recommended)

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Crosstalk-Solutions/unifi-toolkit.git
cd unifi-toolkit
./setup.sh  # Select 2 for Production
# Enter: domain name, admin username, password

# Open firewall ports
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp && sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Start with HTTPS
docker compose --profile production up -d
```

Access at **https://your-domain.com**

## Configuration

### Setup Wizard (Recommended)

Run the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The wizard will:
- Generate encryption key
- Configure deployment mode (local/production)
- Set up authentication (production only)
- Create your `.env` file

### Manual Configuration

Copy and edit the example configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Required Settings

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypts stored credentials (auto-generated by setup wizard) |

#### Deployment Settings (Production Only)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` | `local` or `production` |
| `DOMAIN` | Your domain name (e.g., `toolkit.example.com`) |
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | Admin username |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` | Bcrypt password hash (generated by setup wizard) |

#### UniFi Controller Settings

Configure via `.env` or the web UI (web UI takes precedence):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `UNIFI_CONTROLLER_URL` | Local controller IP/hostname (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1`) |
| `UNIFI_API_KEY` | API key (recommended — generate in UniFi OS Settings → Admins) |
| `UNIFI_USERNAME` | Username (fallback if not using API key) |
| `UNIFI_PASSWORD` | Password (fallback if not using API key) |
| `UNIFI_SITE_ID` | Site ID from URL, not friendly name (default: `default`). For multi-site, use ID from `/manage/site/{id}/...` |
| `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL` | SSL verification (default: `false`) |

> **Note:** Use your controller's local IP address (e.g., `https://192.168.1.1`). Cloud access via `unifi.ui.com` is not supported.

#### Tool Settings

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `STALKER_REFRESH_INTERVAL` | Device refresh interval in seconds (default: `60`) |

## Security

### Authentication

- **Local mode**: No authentication (trusted LAN only)
- **Production mode**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **Rate limiting**: 5 failed login attempts = 5 minute lockout

### HTTPS

Production deployments use Caddy for automatic HTTPS:
- Let's Encrypt certificates (auto-renewed)
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### Multi-Site Networking

When managing multiple UniFi sites, always use site-to-site VPN:

```
✅ RECOMMENDED: VPN Connection
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐
│  UI Toolkit      │◄──VPN──►│  Remote UniFi    │
│  Server          │         │  Controller      │
└──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘

❌ AVOID: Direct Internet Exposure
Never expose UniFi controllers via port forwarding
```

**VPN Options:** UniFi Site-to-Site, WireGuard, Tailscale, IPSec

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to UniFi controller
- **UniFi OS required** — standalone/self-hosted controllers are not supported (v1.11.0+). If you're running the Java-based controller software, v1.10.3 is the last compatible version.
- Set `UNIFI_VERIFY_SSL=false` for self-signed certificates
- API key auth is recommended — generate in UniFi OS Settings → Admins
- Verify network connectivity to controller

### Device not showing as online
- Wait 60 seconds for the next refresh cycle
- Verify MAC address format is correct
- Confirm device is connected in UniFi dashboard

### Let's Encrypt certificate fails
- Verify DNS A record points to your server
- Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open
- Check Caddy logs: `docker compose logs caddy`

### Rate limited on login
- Wait 5 minutes for lockout to expire
- Use `./reset_password.sh` if you forgot your password

### Docker issues
- Verify `.env` exists and contains `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Check logs: `docker compose logs -f`
- Pull latest image: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
